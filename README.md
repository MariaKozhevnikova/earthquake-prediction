Richter's Predictor: Modeling Earthquake Damage Term  

Course:  Machine Learning 

Language: Python

Data source: Dataset was taken from drivendata / competitions 

Scope: Based on aspects of building location and construction, my goal was to predict the level of damage to buildings caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal 

Approach: To measure the performance of algorithms, I used the F1 score. 

Was performed: 
Cleaning, transformation, exploratory analysis, visualization, encoding, correlation, feature selection, 
Training (Random forest classifier, SVC, DecisionTreeClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, GaussianNB,), Hyperparameter Tuning the Random Forest.
